# R workshop

D7:3 retreat, Noors slott, 2018-08-30

## Rationale

Data acquisition is getting faster. Amount of data is increasing. You still have only two eyes and one brain. Ergo, we need better tools to represent complex data.

R is a tool of choice to ensure stable, reproducible, understandable, easily modifiable data representation.

## Goal 

R comes with a relatively high initial threshold. The goal of this three-hour workshop is to get over this initial workshop, and learn how to set it up, get it running, understand the basic concepts, and know where to look for help. 

As an example, you'll load your own data into R and produce a beautiful figure with it.

## Steps

1. Install R & Rstudio
1. First steps into R
1. Loading your own data
1. Your first figure

## Installing prerequisites

To start programming with R on your computer, you need two things: R and RStudio (actually only R, but RStudio makes the experience more enjoyable).

For your convenience, the required files are available on a USB stick during the workshop.

### Install R

To download R, go to CRAN, https://cloud.r-project.org/ (the comprehensive R archive network). Choose your system and select the latest version to install.

### Install RStudio

You also can use a hefty tool to write and compile R codes. And RStudio is the most robust and popular IDE (integrated development environment) for R programming. It is available on http://www.rstudio.com/download. (open source and for free)
